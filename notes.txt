I've done some work on GDPR before but you know you may want to do your own research!

Under GDPR, there are 6 'lawful bases' for processing personal data (https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/). The relevant ones for us are consent and legitimate interest. Getting consent would be a pain for such a simple site. Personalisation (i.e. recommendations) to improve UX is common here, and I think we'd fall under this.


Code generated


Thanks for the clarity Ollie, that helps. I think I misunderstood that the code was unique for each promotion rather than unique for every user for every promotion.


All codes are timestamped at creation, and that will be in the admin panel.

The simplest way to make the code unique is to generate a new code for every new time that page is hit. Here, a user hitting the same promotion twice would get a *different* code. But this is going to make analytics very flawed.


I can also store the (anonymised) IP addresses and associate it to a generated code. The only thing to be aware of is GDPR (I can walk you through this in more detail if you would like.)



Data analytics
Sure, lets use GA. (I'm also going to setup New Reclic which will provide data analytics focused more on the tech/response times etc. I can walk you through it once it's up - it's very neat.) Both will give you the number of page hits, bounce rate, regions etc. The easiest way to learn it is just to play around with it once it's set up.
